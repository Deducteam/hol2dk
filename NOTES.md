## 14/04/24

With PR #126 (generation of spec files):

hol: lp 36s v 25s spec 7s vo -j32 16m22s

Multivariate/make_upto_topology: vo -j32 423m + -j8 62m = 8h

## 09/04/24

Huge improvements in file generation and coq checking:

With PR #120 (use a single type_abbrevs file):

hol: lp 38s v 30s vo -j32 23m51s

With PR #119 (optimization of printing functions):

Multivariate/make_upto_topology: lp 18m11s v 18m43s

## 05/04/24

Multivariate/make_upto_topology: lp 36m13s v 24m

## 03/04/24

With PR #111: Not printing types for lemmas (proof steps) slightly reduces Coq compilation time. For instance, checking hol.ml in Coq takes 28m3s instead of 31m35s (-11%).

With PR #110, --max-proof-size 500_000 --max-abbrev-size 2_000_000:
- URYSOHN_LEMMA: lp 38s v 13s vo -j32 27m43s
- CHAIN_BOUNDARY_BOUNDARY: lp 2m33 v 39s vo -j32 2h58m
- GRASSMANN_PLUCKER_4: size 4m55s lp 1m35s v 1m41s vo -j16 60m22s
- HOMOTOPIC_IMP_HOMOLOGOUS_REL_CHAIN_MAPS: lp 8m9s v 2m vo -j32 9h37m

## 26/03/24

The PR #108 and #109 improves the generation time of big theorems very significantly:

- URYSOHN_LEMMA: 1m6s instead of 6m30s
- CHAIN_BOUNDARY_BOUNDARY: 3m40s instead of 56m
- GRASSMANN_PLUCKER_4: 12m11s instead of 3h25m
- HOMOTOPIC_IMP_HOMOLOGOUS_REL_CHAIN_MAPS: 17m23s instead of 6h49m

It however has a negative impact on small libraries:

- hol.ml: lp 56s v 47s vo 43m13s instead of lp 42s v 45s vo 31m35s

This is because much more files are generated: each term abbreviation file now has its own type abbreviation file and, when splitting proof files, each proof part file has its own term abbreviation files.

## 22/03/24

generation of term abbreviations in parallel

make lp-stage2 can be run in parallel of make lp-stage1 after some time

## 15/03/24

optimize dependencies on proofs too:

hol.ml --max-abbrevs 20000: make -j32 lp 45s v 41s -j16 vo 37m28s
hol.ml --max-abbrevs 10000: make -j32 lp 47s v 47s -j16 vo 42m30s

## 13/03/24

optimize dependencies on term_abbrevs:

hol.ml --max-abbrevs 20000: make -j32 lp 42s v 41s -j16 vo 32m40s

## 12/03/24

splitting term abbrevs by size instead of by number:

hol.ml --max-abbrevs 20000: make -j32 lp 41s v 47s -j16 vo 37m3s

## 11/03/24

generation of .lpo.mk files:

hol.ml:
  - without generation: make -j32 lp 47s dep-lpo 42s
  - with generation: make -j32 lp 46s dep-lpo 0.4s

## 25/01/24

By introducing sharing in term abbreviations, we can reduce the size of some lp files significantly:

| term_abbrevs.lp file                    | generation | size w/o sharing | size w/ sharing | %    |
|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|------|
| CHAIN_BOUNDARY_BOUNDARY                 | 56m29s     | 5.2G             | 1.9G            | -63% |

but coq checking is slowed down: the checking of `hol.ml` takes 40m29s 3.5G with sharing and -j16 (it fails now with -j20) instead of 32m20s 3.1G with -j20 before.

- dump-simp 6m2s 5.4G 82% useless
- lp 21s 734M
- v 31s 682M mkv 23s vo (-j20) 32m

## 17/01/24

the generation of Multivariate/make_upto_topology/GRASSMANN_PLUCKER_4.lp takes too much memory

the problem comes from the fact that the term abbreviations in this file are too big

a solution is to use (maximal) sharing when building the map of term abbreviations

but sharing increases generation time significantly

with split and -j32, hol.ml is translated to lp in 40s instead of 32s (+25%)

in singly-threaded mode, hol.ml is translated to lp in 4m59s instead of 4m7s (+21%)

however GRASSMANN_PLUCKER_4.lp can now be generated in 2 hours (119m23s)

Some theorems are created with no name but are used later. See for instance `pth` in `bool.ml`:

## before 14/10/23

- instrumenting BETA_CONV reduces the number of proof steps of `hol.ml` by 0.1% only

- instrumenting SYM reduces the number of proof steps of `hol.ml` by 4%

- replacing ALPHA by REFL reduces the number of proof steps of `hol_upto_arith` from 405621 to 324391 (-20%)!

- doing dk/lp generation of arith.ml in parallel:
  * lp file generation: 7s 69 Mo
  * checking time with lambdapi: 1m51s

- translation of hol.ml:
  * ocaml checking: 1m23s
  * proof checking + dumping: 1m54s (+37%) 3.8 Go 11 Mo proof steps
  * stats computation: 25s
  * dk generation: 26m47s 3.6 Go

- effect of instrumenting intro/elim rules:

    * number of proof steps: 408777 instead of 564351 (-28%)
    * dk file generation: 22s 99 Mo instead of 45s 153 Mo (-51% and -35%)
    * checking time with dk check: 14s instead of 26s (-46%)
    * checking time with kocheck -j 7: 23s instead of 22s
    * lp file generation: 14s 69 Mo instead of 29s 107 Mo (-51% and -35%)
    * checking time with lambdapi: 2m instead of 2m49s (-29%)

- removing private for hol_type and term increases generation time!
  for arith.lp we get 33s instead of 31s

- generating dk/lp output with a compiled program is faster:

  for arith.ml we get:
    * for dk: 48s instead of 2m6s (-62%)
    * for lp: 29s instead of 1m6 (-56%)

- dumping proofs is fast:
  * arith.ml: 157 Mo in 1.4s
  * hol.ml: 5.5 Go in 2m30s

- generate type abbreviations recursively for types (typex = fun typey
  typez) doesn't seem worthwhile

- making terms more implicit make lambdapi slow down

- effect of sharing types and terms on arith.ml:

    * time of lp file generation: 1m6s instead of 59s (+12%)
    * size of lp files: 103 Mo instead of 217 Mo (-52%)
    * checking time with lambdapi: 3m1s instead of 5m46s (-48%)

  when split in 3 dk files:
  
    * time of dk file generation: 2m08s instead of 1m33s (+38%)
    * size of dk files: 265 Mo instead of 360 Mo (-26%)
      101 Mo (38%) are used by name qualifications
    * checking time with dk check: 40s instead of 1m12s (-44%)
    * checking time with kocheck -j 7: 42s instead of 50s (-16%)

  when in a single dk file:

    * time of dk file generation: 2m6s instead of 1m33s (+35%)
    * size of dk file: 153 Mo instead of 360 Mo (-57%)
    * checking time with dk check: 26s instead of 1m12s (-64%)
    * checking time with kocheck -j 7: 22s instead of 50s (-56%)

- the proof of `! p q. p ==> q ==> p /\ q` requires 263 proof steps
  and generates a lp file of 43482 octets

```
g `! p q. p ==> q ==> p /\ q`;;
e GEN_TAC;;
e GEN_TAC;;
e (DISCH_THEN (LABEL_TAC "p"));;
e (DISCH_THEN (LABEL_TAC "q"));;
e CONJ_TAC;;
e (USE_THEN "p" ACCEPT_TAC);;
e (USE_THEN "q" ACCEPT_TAC);;
top_thm();;
```

- 100/isoperimetric.ml takes 35m to check by ocaml, and requires
  355,603,071 proof steps

- It is currently not efficient to generate a lp file for each proof
  step because the loading mechanism of Lambdapi is not adapted.

Indeed, if a.lp requires b.lp, and b.lp requires c.lp then, when
loading b.lpo, c.lpo is also loaded: loading is recursive. This is due
to the fact that a term in b could contain symbols in c.

With files generated from HOL-Light proof steps, this is however not
the case. Indeed, suppose that thm-x.lp requires theory.lp (definition
of all function symbols) and thm-y.lp. Perhaps thm-y.lp itself has
other dependencies but we do not need to load them because theorems
are opaque: we just need their type which depends on theory.lp only.

This means that the loading mechanism of Lambdapi should be improved
so that a module is loaded only if its symbols are actually necessary.

- use of elementary proof rules from fusion.ml using `gl ' REFL[ ;(]'|wc -l`:

```
REFL 147
TRANS 360
MK_COMB 115
BETA 12
ASSUME 319
EQ_MP 246
DEDUCT_ANTISYM_RULE 23
INST_TYPE 48
INST 326
```

- Q0 rules used for checking arith.ml using `print_proof_stats()`:

number of proof steps: 564351

```
      refl    141216 25%
     trans     46124  8%
      comb     54623 10%
       abs     11173  2%
      beta     17012  3%
    assume     20658  4%
      eqmp    131186 23%
    deduct     42028  7%
term_subst     79941 14%
type_subst     20318  4%
     axiom         9  0%
   sym_def        58  0%
  type_def         6  0%
```

- replacing
```
type thm = Sequent (term list * term * int)
```
by
```
type thm = term list * term * int
```

does not improve checking time of hol.ml
- with Sequent: 1m54s
- without Sequence: 1m55s
