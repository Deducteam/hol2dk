## Unreleased

### Added

- add-links script
- command rewrite to simplify prf files
- command purge to compute useless theorems
  these two commands greatly reduce the size of generated proofs
- command simp is equivalent to rewrite and purge
- command dump-simp is equivalent to dump, pos, use and simp
- allow simultaneous dumping
- Coq mapping for the option type
- command split to generate a pos/use/stp file for each named theorem
  (an stp file contains the starting position of the corresponding proof)
- command theorem to generate the lp files corresponding to a named theorem
- Makefile to generate and check lp and coq files generated with split
- command size to get statistics on the size of terms
- option --print-stats to print statistics on hash tables at exit
- use hash tables instead of maps to build abbreviations maps
- use sharing when building canonical types and terms
- add option --use-sharing for using sharing in lp output when defining term abbreviations

### Modified

- identifier renamings
- merged the command dg in the command mk
- fusion.ml: do not generate new theorems for empty instantiations

### Fixed

- valid dedukti and lambdapi identifiers

## 0.0.1 (2023-11-22)

### Added

- add command dump-use for dumping a file without including "hol.ml"

### Modified

- rename mk-part command into mk
- the dump command now includes "hol.ml"
- do not print ocaml warnings while dumping proofs
- do not export unused proofs (about 7%)
- make hol2dk stat give the number of unused proofs

### Fixed

- README.md
- output of hol2dk axm
- output of hol2dk mk

## 0.0.0 (2023-11-08)
