Export HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti, Lambdapi and Coq
====================================================

This project provides a tool, hol2dk, to translate [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) proofs to [Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/), [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) and [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

[HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) is a proof assistant
based on higher-order logic, aka simple type theory.

[Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/) is a proof format
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting (λ-calculus + simple types +
dependent types + implicit type equivalence modulo user-defined
rewriting rules).

[Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) is a proof assistant
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting that can read and generate
Dedukti proofs.

[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) is a proof assistant based on the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

Usability of translated libraries
---------------------------------

For the obtained theorems to be readily usable in Coq, we need to
align the type and functions of HOL-Light with those used in the Coq
standard library. We already did this for various types and functions
(see [With_N.lp](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/With_N.lp)):

- types: unit, prod, list, option, sum, ascii, N, R, Z
- functions on N: pred, add, mul, pow, le, lt, ge, gt, max, min, sub, div, modulo
- functions on list: app, rev, map, removelast, In, hd, tl
- functions on R: Rle, Rplus, Rmult, Rinv, Ropp, Rabs, Rdiv, Rminus, Rge, Rgt, Rlt, Rmax, Rmin, IZR

Your help is welcome to align more functions!

The correctness of the mappings for types defined before real
numbers (e.g. natural numbers and lists) is proved in
[mappings_N.v](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/mappings_N.v). The
correctness of the mappings for the other types, including real
numbers, is proved here in
[With_N.v](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/With_N.v).

The resulting theorems are gathered in the Opam package
[coq-hol-light](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light) available
in the Coq Opam repository [released](https://github.com/coq/opam). It
currently contains a translation of the
[Multivariate](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/blob/master/Multivariate/make_complex.ml)
library with more than 20,000 theorems on arithmetic, wellfounded
relations, lists, real numbers, integers, basic set theory,
permutations, group theory, matroids, metric spaces, homology,
vectors, determinants, topology, convex sets and functions, paths,
polytopes, Brouwer degree, derivatives, Clifford algebra, integration,
measure theory, complex numbers and analysis, transcendental numbers,
real analysis, complex line integrals, etc.

Coq axioms used to encode HOL-Light proofs
------------------------------------------

HOL-Light is based on classical higher-order logic with functional and propositional extensionality. We use the following Coq axioms to encode them:
```
Axiom classic : forall P:Prop, P \/ ~ P.
Axiom constructive_indefinite_description : forall (A : Type) (P : A->Prop), (exists x, P x) -> { x : A | P x }.
Axiom fun_ext : forall {A B : Type} {f g : A -> B}, (forall x, (f x) = (g x)) -> f = g.
Axiom prop_ext : forall {P Q : Prop}, (P -> Q) -> (Q -> P) -> P = Q.
Axiom proof_irrelevance : forall (P:Prop) (p1 p2:P), p1 = p2.
```

Installing HOL-Light sources
----------------------------

**Requirement:** hol_light >= 3.0.0

```
git clone https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light
make -C hol-light
```

Installing hol2dk
-----------------

**Requirements:**
- ocaml >= 4.13
- dune >= 3.7

hol2dk is available on [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/). To install it, simply do:
```
opam install hol2dk
```

You can also install hol2dk from its sources as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk.git
cd hol2dk
dune build && dune install
```

Setting the environment variables `$HOLLIGHT_DIR` and `$HOL2DK_DIR`
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For some commands to have access to files in hol2dk sources, you need
to set the following environment variables:
```
export HOLLIGHT_DIR=   # absolute path to hol-light source directory
export HOL2DK_DIR=     # absolute path to hol2dk source directory
```

In case you installed hol2dk using opam, write:
```
export HOL2DK_DIR=$OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX/share/hol2dk
```

Summary of hol2dk commands
--------------------------

Get it by running `hol2dk | less`.

Patching HOL-Light sources
--------------------------

By default, HOL-Light does not generate proofs that can be checked independently. Therefore, it must be patched so that proof steps are recorded:

```
hol2dk patch
```

This command slightly modifies a few HOL-Light files in order to dump proofs:
- `fusion.ml`: the HOL-Light kernel file defining types, terms, theorems, proofs and proof rules
- `bool.ml`: HOL-Light file defining basic tactics corresponding to introduction and elimination rules of connectives
- `equal.ml`: HOL-Light file defining basic tactics on equality

The patch also adds a file `xnames.ml`.

Before applying the patch, a copy of these files is created in `fusion-bak.ml`, `bool-bak.ml`, etc.

To restore HOL-Light files, simply do:
```
hol2dk unpatch
```

Dumping HOL-Light proofs
------------------------

For dumping the proofs of a HOL-Light file depending on `hol.ml` do:
```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
hol2dk dump-simp [$path/]file.ml
```

This will generate the following files:
- `[$path/]file.sig`: constants
- `[$path/]file.prf`: theorems (proof steps)
- `[$path/]file.thm`: named theorems
- `[$path/]file.pos`: positions of proof steps in `file.prf`
- `[$path/]file.use`: data about the use of theorems

WARNING: it is important to run the command in `$HOLLIGHT_DIR` so as to compute the list of named theorems properly.

For dumping (a subset of) `hol.ml` do:
```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
hol2dk dump-simp-before-hol file.ml
```
where `file.ml` should at least contain the contents of `hol.ml` until the line `loads "fusion.ml";;`.

The command `dump-simp` (and similarly for `dump-simp-before-hol`) are actually the sequential composition of various lower level commands: `dump`, `pos`, `use`, `rewrite` and `purge`:

**Simplifying dumped proofs.** HOL-Light proofs have many detours that can be simplified following simple rewrite rules. For instance, s(u)=s(u) is sometimes proved by MK_COMB from s=s and u=u, while it can be directly proved by REFL.

The command `rewrite` implements the following simplification rules:
- SYM(REFL(t)) ⟶ REFL(t)
- SYM(SYM(p)) ⟶ p
- TRANS(REFL(t),p) ⟶ p
- TRANS(p,REFL(t)) ⟶ p
- CONJUNCT1(CONJ(p,_)) ⟶ p
- CONJUNCT2(CONJ(_,p)) ⟶ p
- MKCOMB(REFL(t),REFL(u)) ⟶ REFL(t(u))
- EQMP(REFL _,p) ⟶ p

**Purging dumped proofs.** Because HOL-Light tactics may fail, some theorems are generated but not used in the end, especially after simplification. Therefore, they do not need to be translated.

The command `purge` compute in `file.use` all the theorems that do not need to be translated. For instance, in the HOL-Light base library `hol.ml`, 60% of proof steps are useless after simplication.

The command `simp` is the sequential composition of `rewrite` and `purge`.

Translating HOL-Light proofs to Lambdapi and Coq
------------------------------------------------

**Requirements:**
- lambdapi commit >= 21ee7f3d (21/01/25)
- coq >= 8.19
- [coq-hol-light-real-with-N](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light-real-with-N)
- [coq-fourcolor-reals](https://github.com/coq-community/fourcolor/blob/master/coq-fourcolor-reals.opam)

**Procedure after dumping:**

- create a directory where all files will be generated:
```
mkdir output
```

- configure the directory with all the required files:
```
cd output
hol2dk config $hollight_file.ml $root_path [coq_file_or_module] ... [$mapping.mk] [$mapping.lp]
```
Do `hol2dk config` to get more details.

For instance, to translate the Multivariate library using the Coq type N for natural numbers, we use [CONFIG](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light/blob/main/CONFIG).

- You can then do in order:
  * `make` to get the list of targets and variables
  * `make split` to generate a file for each theorem
  * `make -j$jobs lp` to translate HOL-Light proofs to Lambdapi
  * `make -j$jobs lpo` to check Lambdapi files (optional)
  * `make -j$jobs v` to translate Lambdapi files to Coq files
  * `make -j$jobs spec` to merge all small spec files into a single one
  * `make -j$jobs rm-empty-deps` to remove `theory_hol.v`, `${base}_types.v` and `${base}_axioms.v` (to use when these files are empty only)
  * `make -j$jobs vo` to check Coq files

To speed up lp file generation for some theorems with very big proofs, you can write in a file named `BIG_FILES` a list of theorem names (lines starting with `#` are ignored). See for instance [BIG_FILES](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/BIG_FILES). You can also change the default values of the options `--max-proof-size` and `--max-abbrev-size` as follows:
- `make -j$jobs MAX_PROOF=500_000 MAX_ABBREV=2_000_000 lp`

**Remark:** for the checking of generated Coq files to not fail because of lack of RAM, we generate for each theorem `${thm}.lp` one or several files for its proof, and a file `${thm}_spec.lp` declaring this theorem as an axiom. Moreover, each other theorem proof using `${thm}` requires `${thm}_spec` instead of `${thm}`.

Performances
------------

On a machine with 32 processors i9-13950HX, 128 Gb RAM, Hol2dk master, HOL-Light 3.0.0, OCaml 5.2.1, Camlp5 8.03.01, Lambdapi 83cf0be2, Coq 8.20.0, using the Coq type N for HOL-Light natural numbers:

| HOL-Light file               | dump  | size   | steps | thms  | lp  | v   | size  | vo (*) |
|------------------------------|-------|--------|-------|-------|-----|-----|-------|--------|
| hol.ml                       | 4m    | 3 Gb   | 3 M   | 5687  | 40s | 37s | 1 Gb  | 10m23s |
| Multivariate/make_complex.ml | 2h30m | 135 Gb | 85 M  | 40728 | 45m | 24m | 91 Gb | 21h14m |

using `make -j32 lp`, `make -j32 v`, `make -j32 merge-spec-files; make -j32 rm-empty-deps; make -j32 -k v`.

Translating HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti
---------------------------------------

**Requirement:** dedukti 2.7

The Makefile commands above are not implemented for Dedukti yet. It is however possible to translate HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti in parallel by using the following older and less efficient commands:

```
hol2dk mk $nb_parts $base
make -f $base.mk -j$jobs dk
```
where `$base` is the base name of the library, e.g. `make` for `$HOLLIGHT_DIR/Logic/make`, which is also written in the file named `BASE` that is created when you do `hol2dk link Logic/make`.

It generates a single big Dedukti file `$base.dk`. To check it with [dkcheck](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/) version >= 2.7, simply do:
```
dk check $base.dk
```
To check it with [kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs), simply do:
```
kocheck -j$jobs file-for-kocheck.dk
```

Performances: hol.dk can be checked by dkcheck in 4m11s.

Getting statistics on proofs
----------------------------

It is possible to get statistics on proofs by using the command `stat`. For instance, for `hol.ml`, after simplification, we get:

| rule       |  % |
|:-----------|---:|
| comb       | 20 |
| term_subst | 17 |
| refl       | 16 |
| eqmp       | 12 |
| trans      |  9 |
| conjunct1  |  6 |
| abs        |  3 |
| beta       |  3 |
| mp         |  3 |
| sym        |  2 |
| deduct     |  2 |
| type_subst |  2 |
| assume     |  1 |
| conjunct2  |  1 |
| disch      |  1 |
| spec       |  1 |
| disj_cases |  1 |
| conj       |  1 |

Exporting pure Q0 proofs
------------------------

Hol2dk instruments basic HOL-Light tactics corresponding to
introduction and elimination rules of connectives to get smaller
proofs and proofs closer to natural deduction proofs. It is however
possible to generate full Q0 proofs by doing after patching:

```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
sed -i -e 's/.*Q0.*//' -e 's/START_ND*)//' -e 's/(*END_ND//' fusion.ml bool.ml equal.ml
```

Source files
------------

Modified HOL-Light files:
- `lib.ml`: provides functions on lists, etc. required by `fusion.ml`. A few lines are commented out so that it compiles with ocamlc.
- `fusion.ml`: defines types, terms, theorems, proofs and elementary proof rules.
- `bool.ml`: defines basic tactics corresponding to introduction and elimination rules of connectives.
- `equal.ml`: defines basic tactic(al)s on equality including alpha and beta-reduction.
These files contain special comments that are removed to patch hol-light.

Additional files required for `hol2dk`:
- `main.ml`: main program of Hol2dk.
- `xprelude.ml`: provides a few basic definitions.
- `xlib.ml`: functions on types, terms and other data structures.
- `xproof.ml`: functions for accessing proofs.
- `xlp.ml`: translation to Lambdapi of types, terms and proofs.
- `xdk.ml`: translation to Dedukti of types, terms and proofs.
- `xfiles.ml`: functions to compute dependencies and theorems of HOL-Light files.
- `xnames.ml`: functions for dumping the index of named theorems.

Note that all these files can be used in the OCaml toplevel as well by removing the `open` instructions and by adding `unset_jrh_lexer;;` and `set_jrh_lexer;;` at the beginning and at the end of the file.

Files necessary for the export to Coq: all the lp and v files.
