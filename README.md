Export HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti, Lambdapi and Coq
====================================================

This project provides a tool to translate [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) proofs to [Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/), [Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) and [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

[HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) is a proof assistant
based on higher-order logic, aka simple type theory.

[Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/) is a proof format
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting (λ-calculus + simple types +
dependent types + implicit type equivalence modulo user-defined
rewriting rules).

[Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) is a proof assistant
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting that can read and generate
Dedukti proofs.

[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) is a proof assistant based on the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions.

Results
-------

The HOL-Light base library `hol.ml` and the libraries `Arithmetic` and
`Logic` formalizing the metatheory of first-order logic can be
exported and translated to Dedukti, Lambdapi and Coq in a few
minutes. The generated Dedukti files can be checked in a few minutes
as well, but it takes a much longer time for Coq and Lambdapi to check
the generated files (16 minutes for Coq for `hol.ml`).

For bigger libraries like `Multivariate`, it takes more time,
especially for Coq. For instance, the `Multivariate` library up to
`topology.ml` can be translated to Lambdapi in 18 minutes, then to Coq
in 18 more minutes, but the verification of the generated files by Coq
takes 8 hours.

While it is possible to translate any HOL-Light
proof to Coq, the translated theorems may not be directly applicable by
Coq users because not all HOL-Light types and functions are aligned
with those of the Coq standard library yet. Currently, we only aligned
the types of natural numbers and lists, and some functions on them in
the file
[coq.v](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/coq.v). We
gathered the resulting theorems in the Opam package
[coq-hol-light](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light) available
in the Coq Opam repository [released](https://github.com/coq/opam). We
plan to add more mappings, especially on real numbers.

Coq axioms used to encode HOL-Light proofs
------------------------------------------

HOL-Light is based on classical higher-order logic with functional and propositional extensionality. We use the following Coq axioms to encode them:
```
Axiom classic : forall P:Prop, P \/ ~ P.
Axiom constructive_indefinite_description : forall (A : Type) (P : A->Prop), (exists x, P x) -> { x : A | P x }.
Axiom fun_ext : forall {A B : Type} {f g : A -> B}, (forall x, (f x) = (g x)) -> f = g.
Axiom prop_ext : forall {P Q : Prop}, (P -> Q) -> (Q -> P) -> P = Q.
Axiom proof_irrelevance : forall (P:Prop) (p1 p2:P), p1 = p2.
```

If you don't already have the HOL-Light sources somewhere, you can
install them by using the following commands:

```
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install -y libipc-system-simple-perl libstring-shellquote-perl opam
opam init
opam switch create ocaml.4.14.1
eval `opam env`

Installing hol2dk
-----------------

**Requirements:**
- ocaml >= 4.13
- dune >= 3.7

hol2dk is available on [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/). To install it, simply do:
```
opam install hol2dk
```

You can also install hol2dk from its sources as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk.git
cd hol2dk
dune build && dune install
```

Setting the environment variables `$HOLLIGHT_DIR` and `$HOL2DK_DIR`
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For some commands to have access to files in hol2dk sources, you need
to set the following environment variables:
```
export HOLLIGHT_DIR=   # absolute path to hol-light source directory
export HOL2DK_DIR=     # absolute path to hol2dk source directory
```

In case you installed hol2dk using opam, write:
```
export HOL2DK_DIR=$OPAM_SWITCH_PREFIX/share/hol2dk
```

Summary of hol2dk commands
--------------------------

Get it by running `hol2dk | less`.

Patching HOL-Light sources
--------------------------

By default, HOL-Light does not generate proofs that can be checked independently. Therefore, it must be patched so that proof steps are recorded:

```
hol2dk patch
```

This command slightly modifies a few HOL-Light files in order to dump proofs:
- `fusion.ml`: the HOL-Light kernel file defining types, terms, theorems, proofs and proof rules
- `bool.ml`: HOL-Light file defining basic tactics corresponding to introduction and elimination rules of connectives
- `equal.ml`: HOL-Light file defining basic tactics on equality

The patch also adds a file `xnames.ml`.

Before applying the patch, a copy of these files is created in `fusion-bak.ml`, `bool-bak.ml`, etc.

To restore HOL-Light files, simply do:
```
hol2dk unpatch
```

Dumping HOL-Light proofs
------------------------

For dumping the proofs of a HOL-Light file depending on `hol.ml` do:
```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
hol2dk dump-simp [$path/]file.ml
```

This will generate the following files:
- `[$path/]file.sig`: constants
- `[$path/]file.prf`: theorems (proof steps)
- `[$path/]file.thm`: named theorems
- `[$path/]file.pos`: positions of proof steps in `file.prf`
- `[$path/]file.use`: data about the use of theorems

WARNING: it is important to run the command in `$HOLLIGHT_DIR` so as to compute the list of named theorems properly.

For dumping (a subset of) `hol.ml` do:
```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
hol2dk dump-simp-before-hol file.ml
```
where `file.ml` should at least contain the contents of `hol.ml` until the line `loads "fusion.ml";;`.

The command `dump-simp` (and similarly for `dump-simp-before-hol`) are actually the sequential composition of various lower level commands: `dump`, `pos`, `use`, `rewrite` and `purge`:

**Simplifying dumped proofs.** HOL-Light proofs have many detours that can be simplified following simple rewrite rules. For instance, s(u)=s(u) is sometimes proved by MK_COMB from s=s and u=u, while it can be directly proved by REFL.

The command `rewrite` implements the following simplification rules:
- SYM(REFL(t)) ⟶ REFL(t)
- SYM(SYM(p)) ⟶ p
- TRANS(REFL(t),p) ⟶ p
- TRANS(p,REFL(t)) ⟶ p
- CONJUNCT1(CONJ(p,_)) ⟶ p
- CONJUNCT2(CONJ(_,p)) ⟶ p
- MKCOMB(REFL(t),REFL(u)) ⟶ REFL(t(u))
- EQMP(REFL _,p) ⟶ p

**Purging dumped proofs.** Because HOL-Light tactics may fail, some theorems are generated but not used in the end, especially after simplification. Therefore, they do not need to be translated.

The command `purge` compute in `file.use` all the theorems that do not need to be translated. For instance, in the HOL-Light base library `hol.ml`, 60% of proof steps are useless after simplication.

The command `simp` is the sequential composition of `rewrite` and `purge`.

Translating HOL-Light proofs to Lambdapi and Coq in parallel
------------------------------------------------------------

**Requirement:** lambdapi >= 2.5.0

For not cluttering HOL-Light sources with the many generated files, we suggest to proceed as follows. For instance, for generating the proofs of the `Logic` library, do:
```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR/Logic
hol2dk dump-simp make.ml
mkdir -p ~/output-hol2dk/Logic
cd ~/output-hol2dk/Logic
hol2dk link Logic/make
```
This will add links to files needed to generate, translate and check proofs.

You can then do in order:
- `make split` to generate a file for each theorem
- `make -j$jobs lp` to translate HOL-Light proofs to Lambdapi
- `make -j$jobs lpo` to check Lambdapi files (optional)
- `make -j$jobs v` to translate Lambdapi files to Coq files
- `make -j$jobs spec` for Coq checking to require less memory (optional)
- `make -j$jobs vo` to check Coq files

To speed up lp file generation for some theorems with very big proofs, you can write in a file called `BIG_FILES` a list of theorem names (lines starting with `#` are ignored). See for instance [BIG_FILES](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk/blob/main/BIG_FILES). You can also change the default values of the options `--max-proof-size` and `--max-abbrev-size` as follows:
- `make -j$jobs MAX_PROOF='--max-proof-size 500_000' MAX_ABBREV='--max-max-abbrev 2_000_000' lp`

Performance on 15/04/24
-----------------------

On a machine with 32 processors i9-13950HX and 64G RAM:

| HOL-Light file                     | dump-simp | dump size | proof steps | nb theorems | make -j32 lp | make -j32 v | v files size | make -j32 vo |
|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| hol.ml                             | 3m57s     | 3 Go      | 5 M         | 5679        | 36s          | 25s         | 0.4 Go       | 16m22s       |
| Multivariate/make_upto_topology.ml | 48m       | 52 Go     | 52 M        | 18866       | 18m11s       | 18m43s      | 2.3 Go       | 8h (*)       |

(*) with `make spec; make -j32 vo; make -j8 vo`

Translating HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti
---------------------------------------

The Makefile commands above are not implemented for Dedukti yet. It is however possible to translate HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti in parallel by using the following older and less efficient commands:

```
hol2dk mk $nb_parts $base
make -f $base.mk -j$jobs dk
```
where `$base` is the base name of the library, e.g. `make` for `$HOLLIGHT_DIR/Logic/make`, which is also written in the file named `BASE` that is created when you do `hol2dk link Logic/make`.

It generates a single big Dedukti file `$base.dk`. To check it with [dkcheck](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/) version >= 2.7, simply do:
```
dk check $base.dk
```
To check it with [kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs), you need to slightly
change the generated file:

```
sed -e 's/^injective /def /g' file.dk > file-for-kocheck.dk
kocheck -j$jobs file-for-kocheck.dk
```

Performances: hol.dk can be checked by dkcheck in 4m11s.

Alignments of HOL-Light types and definitions with those of Coq standard library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While it is possible to translate any HOL-Light library to Coq, the
obtained theorems may not be directly applicable by Coq users because
HOL-Light types and functions may not be aligned with those of the Coq
standard library yet. Currently, only the following types and
functions have been aligned with those of Coq:

- unit type
- product type constructor
- type of natural numbers
- functions and predicates on natural numbers: addition, multiplication, order, power, maximum, minimum, substraction, factorial, division, division remainder, parity
- sum type constructor
- option type constructor
- type of lists
- functions on lists

The part of HOL-Light that is aligned with Coq is gathered in the package
[coq-hol-light](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light) available
in the Coq Opam repository [released](https://github.com/coq/opam).

Getting statistics on proofs
----------------------------

It is possible to get statistics on proofs by using the command `stat`. For instance, for `hol.ml`, after simplification, we get:

| rule       |  % |
|:-----------|---:|
| comb       | 20 |
| term_subst | 17 |
| refl       | 16 |
| eqmp       | 12 |
| trans      |  9 |
| conjunct1  |  6 |
| abs        |  3 |
| beta       |  3 |
| mp         |  3 |
| sym        |  2 |
| deduct     |  2 |
| type_subst |  2 |
| assume     |  1 |
| conjunct2  |  1 |
| disch      |  1 |
| spec       |  1 |
| disj_cases |  1 |
| conj       |  1 |

Exporting pure Q0 proofs
------------------------

Hol2dk instruments basic HOL-Light tactics corresponding to
introduction and elimination rules of connectives to get smaller
proofs and proofs closer to natural deduction proofs. It is however
possible to generate full Q0 proofs by doing after patching:

```
cd $HOLLIGHT_DIR
sed -i -e 's/.*Q0.*//' -e 's/START_ND*)//' -e 's/(*END_ND//' fusion.ml bool.ml equal.ml
```

Source files
------------

Modified HOL-Light files:
- `lib.ml`: provides functions on lists, etc. required by `fusion.ml`. A few lines are commented out so that it compiles with ocamlc.
- `fusion.ml`: defines types, terms, theorems, proofs and elementary proof rules.
- `bool.ml`: defines basic tactics corresponding to introduction and elimination rules of connectives.
- `equal.ml`: defines basic tactic(al)s on equality including alpha and beta-reduction.
These files contain special comments that are removed to patch hol-light.

Additional files required for `hol2dk`:
- `main.ml`: main program of Hol2dk.
- `xprelude.ml`: provides a few basic definitions.
- `xlib.ml`: functions on types, terms and other data structures.
- `xproof.ml`: functions for accessing proofs.
- `xlp.ml`: translation to Lambdapi of types, terms and proofs.
- `xdk.ml`: translation to Dedukti of types, terms and proofs.
- `xfiles.ml`: functions to compute dependencies and theorems of HOL-Light files.
- `xnames.ml`: functions for dumping the index of named theorems.
- `xci.ml`: slightly truncated version of the HOL-Light file `hol.ml` used for testing.

Note that all these files can be used in the OCaml toplevel as well by removing the `open` instructions and by adding `unset_jrh_lexer;;` and `set_jrh_lexer;;` at the beginning and at the end of the file.

Files necessary for the export to Coq: `encoding.lp`, `erasing.lp`, `renaming.lp`, `coq.v`.
