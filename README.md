Export HOL-Light proofs to Dedukti and Lambdapi
===============================================

This project provides several things:
- a script `patch-hol-light` to patch HOL-Light to dump proofs
- a script `unpatch-hol-light` to unpatch HOL-Light
- a script `dump-proofs` to dump proofs
- a compiled OCaml program `hol2dk` to generate Dedukti or Lambdapi files from dumped files

[HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) is proof assistant
based on higher-order logic, aka simple type theory.

[Dedukti](https://github.com/Deducteam/Dedukti/) is a proof format
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting (λ-calculus + simple types +
dependent types + implicit type equivalence modulo user-defined
rewriting rules).

[Lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi) is a proof assistant
based on the λΠ-calculus modulo rewriting that can read and generate
Dedukti proofs.

Installing HOL-Light
--------------------

**Requirements:**
- libipc-system-simple-perl
- libstring-shellquote
- ocaml 4.14.1
- camlp5.8.00.03
- ocamlfind
- num

Find other potential working ocaml-camlp5 pairs on
https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/pull/71 .

If you don't have HOL-Light already installed, you can install it in
the current directory using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get install -y libipc-system-simple-perl libstring-shellquote
-perl
opam install ocamlfind num camlp5
git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light
make -C hol-light
```

Patching HOL-Light
------------------

```
./patch-hol-light $hol-light-dir
```

This script slightly modifies the kernel of HOL-Light, the file
`fusion.ml`, to dump proofs.

Dumping HOL-Light proofs
------------------------

```
cd $hol-light-dir
$hol2dk-dir/dump-proofs file.ml
```

generates two temporary files, `proofs.dump` and `signature.dump`,
which are renamed at the end into `file_proofs.dump` and
`file_sig.dump`.

`file.ml` should at least include `hol.ml` until the line `loads
"fusion.ml";;`.

Compiling hol2dk
----------------

**Requirements:**
- ocaml >= 4.14.1
- dune >= 3.7

```
dune build
```

Get statistics on proofs
------------------------

```
cd $hol2dk-dir
dune exec -- hol2dk $hol-light-dir/signature.dump $hol-light-dir/proofs.dump
```

Remark: each time hol2dk is run, an empty file `proofs.dump` is
generated. You can safely remove it.

Generating dk/lp files from dump files
--------------------------------------

```
cd $hol2dk-dir
dune exec -- hol2dk $hol-light-dir/signature.dump $hol-light-dir/proofs.dump file.dk
```

generates `file.dk` from the given dumped files.

```
cd $hol2dk-dir
dune exec -- hol2dk $hol-light-dir/signature.dump $hol-light-dir/proofs.dump file.lp
```

generates the files `file_types.lp`, `file_terms.lp` and `file.lp`
from the dumped files.

Checking the generated dk file
------------------------------

**Requirement:** dedukti 2.7, lambdapi 2.3 or [kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs)

To check the generated dk file with dkcheck, do:
```
dk check file.dk
```

To check the generated dk file with the current version of
[kocheck](https://github.com/01mf02/kontroli-rs), you need to slightly
change the generated file:

```
sed -e 's/^injective /def /g' file.dk > file-for-kocheck.dk
kocheck -j 7 file-for-kocheck.dk
```

Checking the generated lp files
-------------------------------

**Requirement:** lambdapi 2.3

To check the generated lp files with
[lambdapi](https://github.com/Deducteam/lambdapi), do:

```
lambdapi check --map-dir hol-light:. file.lp
```

or create a file `lambdapi.pkg`:
```
package_name = hol-light
root_path = hol-light
```

and simply do:

```
lambdapi check file.lp
```

**Remark:** In case hol-light and dkcheck/lambdapi do not use the same
ocaml versions, it is convenient to use different switches in each
directory:

Xterm 1 (for HOL-Light):
```
cd hol-light
opam switch link 4.02.3
eval `opam env`
```

Xterm 2 (for checking dk/lp files):
```
opam switch link 4.14.1
eval `opam env`
```

Results
-------

Impact of proof recording on hol-light:

for checking hol.ml:
- without proof recording: 1m18s
-    with proof recording: 1m32s (+18%)
- proof dumping: 2m30s 5.5Go

On `hol.ml` until `arith.ml` (by commenting from `loads "wf.ml"` to the end):
- proof checking and dumping: 12.8s 101 Mo
- number of proof steps: 408777
- dk file generation: 22s 99 Mo
- checking time with dk check: 14s
- checking time with kocheck -j 7: 23s
- lp file generation: 14s 69 Mo
- checking time with lambdapi: 2m

Getting information on HOL-Light files and theorems
---------------------------------------------------

```
#use "topfind";;
#require "camlp5";;
#load "camlp5o.cma";;
#load "str.cma";;
#use "xprelude.ml";;
#use "hol.ml";;
(* #use any other HOL-Light file here *)

#use "xlib.ml";;
#use "xnames.ml";;

(* list of HOL-Light files *)
files;;

(* map giving the names of theorems proved in each file *)
update_map_file_thms();;
!map_file_thms;;

(* map giving the name of each named theorem number *)
update_map_thm_id_name();;
!map_thm_id_name;;

(* map giving the number of every named theorem *)
update_map_thm_name_id();;
!map_name_thm_id;;

(* function returning the number of a theorem name *)
thm_id;;

(* dependency graph of HOL-Light files *)
update_map_file_deps();;
!map_file_deps;;

(* function outputing the dependency graph in Makefile syntax *)
print_map_file_deps_to;;

(* function giving the declared dependencies of a file *)
deps;;

(* function giving the list of all files a file depends on*)
trans_deps;;
```

Exporting Q0 proofs
-------------------

Hol2dk instruments basic HOL-Light tactics corresponding to
introduction and elimination rules of connectives to get smaller
proofs and proofs closer to natural deduction proofs. It is however
possible to generate full Q0 proofs by patching HOL-Light files as
follows:

```
cd $hol-light-dir
sed -i -e 's/.*Q0.*//' -e 's/START_ND*)//' -e 's/(*END_ND//' fusion.ml bool.ml
```

On `hol.ml` until `arith.ml` (by commenting from `loads "wf.ml"` to the end):
- ocaml proof checking: 12.5s
- ocaml proof checking and recording: 13.2s
- number of proof steps: 564351
- proof dumping: 1.4s 157 Mo
- dk file generation: 45s 153 Mo
- checking time with dk check: 26s
- checking time with kocheck -j 7: 22s
- lp file generation: 29s 107 Mo
- checking time with lambdapi: 2m49s
